## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- TypeScript

### What I learned

This is my first NextJS project. From the point of view of NextJS, this is very basic. But there're some frustrating layouts, and the dynamic part is not easy at all. For me, this is a tough project.
